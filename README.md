# Code-Refactor_HW-1

For this project I first went through the html and added formatting to make it more readable. 

Next I fixed errors with the img tag and added alt text. 

I then went through and added in semantic HTML, as well as updating the css to match. 

I also went through the css to consolidate some of the sections.
