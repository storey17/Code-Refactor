# Code-Refactor_HW-1

For this project I first went through the HTML and added formatting to follow a logical structure. 

Next I fixed errors and updated the HTML with img tag, img alt text, links and page title. 

I then went through and added in semantic HTML, as well as updating the css to match. 

I also went through the css to consolidate some of the sections and to reorganize them to make sure they match the layout of the page.
